#Post-Discussion Debrief

##What new insights came out of the discussion?
I think that everyone learned a lot about capabilities from your talk about them- the paper was a little too abstract to really get the idea across for most of us, so you helped us understand that a lot better. In the discussion, the others discovered that the process isolation scheme was a manifestation of protection domains, which I don't think I was able to get across in my presentation. 

##Was there disagreement? Why?
There wasn't a whole lot of disagreement, which I think stems from the fact that people are so reluctant to speak online. However, we did have some debate over whether the UNIX rwx permission system was an ACM, due in part to the fact that it deviated significantly from the 'matrix' design. 

##What was the consensus about the work?
The consensus was that the work created important models and discussion points for security at the time. As has been mentioned several times, this paper didn't build anything or test a new result, but created a language in which other researchers can talk about protection and security, and people seemed to agree that this paper accomplished that goal.
